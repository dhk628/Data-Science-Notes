# Data Science Notes

This is a repository containing my data science notes, where I summarize various topics in data science, machine learning, and related fields. The notes are meant to be a simplified exposition that I can use to review key concepts, and none of the content is originally mine. I have listed the references that I used at the end of the PDF file.
